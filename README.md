# Regression tutorial in WebPPL

This is a short tutorial on regression (linear, logistic, with random effects) inspired by a [tutorial article](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/statistics/BayesLMMs.html) by Sorensen, Hohenstein, and Vasishth. The Sorensen et al. tutorial uses STAN, while this uses [WebPPL](http://webppl.org). 

The tutorial can be walked through in R / RStudio following `regression.Rmd`. We use the R package [RWebPPL](https://github.com/mhtess/rwebppl) to access WebPPL. See the RWebPPL page for details about system requirements.

This tutorial was originally used in a course on Bayesian data analysis, taught in the Summer of 2016. More about this course can be found [here](http://www.stanford.edu/class/psych201s/).
